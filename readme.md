CSPhD students should be able to navigate the repository to find the desired information. The Board must ensure all CSPhD students are aware of the existence of the repository and how to access it. The current version of this is a wiki linked on the [CSPAC website](cspac.cs.northwestern.edu). 

#### 3.2.2. E-mail Account
##### 3.2.2.a. Purpose
The CSPAC email address, cspac@u.northwestern.edu, shall exist to allow for

The Board must also ensure that CSPhD students are aware CSPAC meetings are open to all CSPhD students.

#### 3.2.4. Confidentiality
If you send an email to CSPAC that concerns a private matter we will keep it confidential amongst the board.
When advocating for student needs unless directly requested we anonymize the feedback when presented to faculty or staff.
We will contact the student before deleting any messages when a new board transitions in.
However if the message indicates you are in danger of harming yourself or others we will forward it to the appropriate sources.
